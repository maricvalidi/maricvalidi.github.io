            "Wobbly Life has a lot of potential. As it is now, it is still a pretty decent game, however it could use some work, which is to expected as it is in early access.\nFirst, clippings. This is somewhat annoying. If I want to go from the road to the sidewalk, the atomically small level of height difference makes it so I have to jump \n My first thought was to make those types of things' clippings as small ramps, but to save the team from working on everything, a smarter way would to somehow change how the character walks. Maybe have their legs lift up more with each step"
